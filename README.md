# ​​Perform SLAM on Rough Terrains ​ 

## Description
​​This tutorial is a part of the MathWorks Autonomous Construction Vehicle deep dive video series. This tutorial covers how to implement simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for vehicles driving on rough, off-highway terrains. It includes a pre-recorded ROSbag of 3D lidar and motion data from a vehicle driving in a simulated construction site, and a sequence of steps to tune the parameters in the SLAM algorithm provided in Navigation Toolbox for improved results. ​ 


## Installation
Download the entire folder, and run PerformSLAMOnRoughTerrains.mlx

Users are also encouraged to change any parameters in the script to test varations of this demo.
